    <p>NEEDLEDUST narrates a story of creating heirloom pieces with excellence in craftsmanship.
    As we continue to make beautiful shoes, we are very excited to write yet another new
    chapter and share it with you- Introducing NEEDLEDUST Purses.</p>
    <p>Inspired by the very thought, that women carry the world on the shoulders, and our purses are our beautiful armors that must carry our essentials for that. Our purses shapes and sizes are designed for all your necessities- a large phone, a wallet, keys, a lipstick, a mini mirror perhaps a chocolate too!</p>
    <p>All our purses are handcrafted and handmade with utmost love, using the most beautiful gems, beads and threads. You can also match them with our shoes to make the perfect gifts for special occasions.</p>
    <strong>CARE FOR YOUR PURSES</strong>
    <p>Store your purses in the muslin bag, so they can retain their shine.</p>
