    <h2>A DREAM IN THE MAKING</h2>
    <p>It was in 2018 that our founder, Shirin Mann, first entered the thought of NEEDLEDUST Man in her product calendar. Since then, after much research on optimal construction and fits, and patterns and designs, this dream has seen fruition as a new collection, NEEDLEDUST Man. For the first time, a well-known luxury jutti brand has launched a premium, handcrafted collection for men with completely original designs and unique motifs.</p><br></br>
    <h3>NEW! MEN’S JUTTIS LAUNCHED!</h3>
    <p>We’ve just launched our all-new collection of men’s juttis: NEEDLEDUST Man! Elegant and timeless designs that span the occasion quotient for juttis for men, from the perfect groom’s shoe for weddings to a great casual companion for a lazy Sunday brunch! In short, designs that are a perfect match for a wide spectrum of sartorial adventure—from sherwani shoes to juttis that team well with jeans and tees!   The colours that we have chosen for our all new collection of men’s juttis are exactly the kind that men love wearing. Of course, there’s the quintessential black jutti for men, Boaz, with subtle hand-sewn embellishments that are perfect for casual Sundays as well as the more formal cocktail dinners. Fancy a sherwani? Obviously, you need a sherwani jutti to match! Our pairs such as Jay and Romeo make for superb choices. Want to go a bit more avant-garde? Our fancy gent’s juttis can make heads turn with their superbly unique designs and their haute couture look. Try Kaipo, Rex or Gaia. The supremely artistic pairs are simply fabulous for style-conscious men who are willing to bridge the fashion gap. For the timeless leather jutti man, we have Zale, a tan version that’s a perennial classic, recreated in a modern avatar, with style, class and some hand embellishment! For a great pair of wedding juttis, any pair from our carefully handcrafted range will make an excellent companion on the day you pledge your vows. (Or any of the days before and after that too!) Not only will they make you look dapper, but your feet will thank them for their emphasis on comfort.</p><br></br>
    <h3>HANDCRAFTED LUXURY JUTTIS FOR MEN</h3>
    <p>When a luxury brand that’s well known for its attention to detail and finish, accompanied by authenticity of design, enters a new segment, it compels attention from its fans and loyalists, as well as the industry at large. NEEDLEDUST is a celebrity favourite and naturally, the men’s collection is seeing a huge amount of interest. The new collection has been designed keeping the needs of the modern mind in mind. Each pair has been specially designed keeping in mind the needs of todays’ man, and the exacting demands he makes on his footwear.  Any style-conscious man’s wardrobe is a tad incomplete without at least one pair of juttis from our newly launched collection of men’s juttis! Our jutti designs for men cover the gamut of the casual classics needed for the everyday as well as the stylish elegance that special occasions demand such as wedding juttis for men, or the right men’s jutti for sherwanis. The groom’s wedding juttis need to be just right, stylish and comfortable as the couple say their vows. Wedding juttis for men need to keep their intrinsic values of handcrafted luxury for feet on a very special occasion!</p><br></br>
    <h3>WHAT CAN I PAIR MEN’S JUTTIS WITH?</h3>
<p>Actually, the answer to this question is really very easy. You can pair our mens’s juttis with any outfit you own. If Steven Spielberg can walk the Oscars’ red carpet in a pair of sneakers, why not you? The Indian man of today needs to be clear and create his own unique sense of fashion that serves him well within domestic frontiers, as well as on the world stage. Reclaim your sense of fashion with the addition of Punjabi juttis for men or gent’s juttis or simply men’s juttis as they are called.  Our men’s juttis can be paired with practically any outfit you own. If it’s an ethnic pajama-kurta or a churidar-kurta or even a dhoti-kurta for the really stylish, then obviously a pair of men’s juttis are absolutely perfect for the occasion. However, the evolution of men’s style and the new, contemporary interpretation of men’s juttis make them the quintessential footwear, perfectly in sync with a pair of jeans, jodhpuri trousers or the relaxed fit, easy silhouette bottoms that are so popular today.</p>
<h3>CAN I WEAR JUTTIS FOR FESTIVE OCCASIONS?</h3>
<p>With the resurgence of ethnic attire for men and the definite tilt towards wearing a sherwani or an Indian-inspired outfit for the wedding ceremony, it’s a cinch that wedding juttis for men are in huge demand. Men too want to put their best foot forward and look good enough to at least match their bride’s gorgeous ensemble. However, juttis for men are not just for weddings. The fabulous versatility of men’s juttis makes them inspiring enough to be worn with daily casual wear as well as those occasions that need dressing up. Whether it’s a first date, men’s footwear are seeing a more fashion-forward outlook towards attire but also specifically, men’s footwear. From a night out with your buddies, a movie date with your girlfriend, a special family lunch or that special dinner where you’re going to pop the question, gent’s juttis are now re-incarnated under fancy juttis for gents! A primary reason being that not only do they mix and match with ease, but they are also handcrafted to wear very easy. Your feet will still feel like a million bucks after a long stint in the handcrafted comfort of our men’s juttis.</p>
